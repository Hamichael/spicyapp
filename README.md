Working repo for Team 5 Project C# Programming

Development Version 2
---------------------

Class ingData is created to mirror data that will be aquired from a database. This is done to prevent direct modifications to the database.

ingData is a basic class with 2 strings, 1 int, with standard set and get methods.


The program will automatically populate data into the combo box.
This is where you read data from the text file.

If at any point the database is update outside of the program, a refresh button is provided.

The add button will add an ingredient to the text file, provided it passes validation. It also refreshes data in the combo box after adding the data.


Currently, the regex, add button, and data inside the combo box has been validated
Personally throughly tested entry of data and what actually gets put in the text file, as well as what is displayed.


Planned features will be batch processing of ingredient adding and updating.
